Opting for our full Brazilian wax service in Phoenix offers many advantages.

Consider the negative aspects of shaving. When you shave, the hair can grow thicker, itchier, and coarser. The shaving process doesn't provide a long-term solution either.

Additionally, the wax temperature should remain comfortable. Our estheticians understand the art involved with using the appropriate temperature.&nbsp;

You can also choose to use a bikini full wax. The bikini full waxing procedure removes the hair from around the mons pubis area. The mons pubis area covers the lower abdomen and extends to the labia. The process does not include the rear area.&nbsp;

When you select the Brazilian wax method, you can tell your esthetician whether you want full coverage or want some hair to remain. For example, some women keep a small triangle, a small strip, or a square shape.
