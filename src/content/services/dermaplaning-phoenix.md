If you are in search of dermaplaning in Phoenix, Rejuvenate You has you covered.

This treatment is also known as skin resurfacing. We gently scrape off the outermost layer of your skin to reveal a fresh new layer underneath. This process can reduce the appearance of peach fuzz and leave you with a smooth complexion.&nbsp;

The procedure is less abrasive than microdermabrasion because it doesn't remove as much healthy tissue.

It may not be suitable for everyone, though. Those with dry or sensitive skin may experience increased sensitivity after dermaplaning.

Dermaplaning is a proven solution to countless skin problems. The best way to determine if this is right for you is to speak with a licensed professional.

At Rejuvenate You, we will assess your skin and let you know what kind of results we think dermaplaning would achieve based on your specific concerns. This treatment is generally ideal for the following:

Acne scars are the result of inflammation and infection of the skin. They can be superficial or deep, flat or raised, red, white, or purple.

Dermaplaning removes acne scars by exfoliating the top layer of dead skin cells to reveal newer, healthier skin underneath. This process helps unclog pores for improved oil flow. As a result, it allows for faster cell turnover and fewer clogged pores that cause acne breakouts in the first place!

The treatment makes skin smooth, bright and even in tone. Dermaplaning also allows skincare products, such as serums and sunscreen, to penetrate deeper into the skin, making them more effective.

In addition, it makes makeup application smoother and more even by removing dead skin cells and hair that can cause makeup to look flaky or patchy. And the removing of vellus hair also make the skin look more smooth, soft and clean.
