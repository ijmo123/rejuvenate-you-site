Opting for our full Brazilian wax service in Scottsdale offers many advantages.

Consider the negative aspects of shaving. When you shave, the hair can grow thicker, itchier, and coarser. The shaving process doesn't provide a long-term solution either.

Additionally, the wax temperature should remain comfortable. Our estheticians understand the art involved with using the appropriate temperature.&nbsp;

You can also choose to use a bikini full wax. The bikini full waxing procedure removes the hair from around the mons pubis area. The mons pubis area covers the lower abdomen and extends to the labia. The process does not include the rear area.&nbsp;

When you select the Brazilian wax method, you can tell your esthetician whether you want full coverage or want some hair to remain. For example, some women keep a small triangle, a small strip, or a square shape.

Take a warm shower before your Brazilian wax session. It will help to open up the pores and make it easier for the wax to adhere to the hair.

Exfoliate the area before Brazilian waxing. Exfoliating helps remove dead skin cells and dirt, which can otherwise lead to irritation or discomfort during Brazilian waxing. Don't use any creams or lotions before Brazilian waxing. It will help ensure that the wax sticks to the hair and not your skin.

Trim any pubic hairs before coming in for your session. It will keep all the hair even in length, which can minimize pain during Brazilian waxing. You should also make sure you have enough hair to wax. Check to see if you have at least ¼” of growth. Checking this will ensure that the wax can adhere to the hair.

Using these tips will help reduce pain and discomfort as we work to create an enjoyable experience.

Here is what you can expect with your Brazilian wax session.
