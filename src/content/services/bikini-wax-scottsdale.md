Pubic hair removal is more popular than ever, and bikini waxing is one of the most convenient and effective ways to achieve smooth skin.

The feeling of rejuvenation and renewal is a reason why most chose to get this service.&nbsp;

With shaving, you’re cutting the hair above the root. The same hair will grow back and often develop a thick and stubbly feel as it does so. This process can be very uncomfortable, and results typically don’t last more than a week.

Everyone has a different pain threshold, but our esthetician can reduce pain and discomfort by getting wax to the right temperature. It should be hot enough to melt not warm enough to hurt your skin. The experienced esthetician will have mind-body techniques such as breathing suggestions and other ways to calm the pain receptors.

There is also an expert gesture to tear off the wax in a swift motion. If done quickly and effectively, this part of the process causes brief and minimal pain.&nbsp;

Don’t hesitate to voice your concerns regarding pain and discomfort. Our esthetician will answer all your questions and make sure you have the most comfortable experience.

You can also opt for a bikini full wax. This procedure removes the hair that grows in the mons pubis area, from the lower abdomen to the labia but does not cover the anus also known as the butt strip. Some chose to leave a small amount of hair with smooth and orderly edging.

Make sure you have enough hair growth before scheduling your appointment. You need to have at least ¼” of growth so that the wax can properly capture the hair.

You can prep your skin with a warm bath or a gentle exfoliating product the night before your appointment.

We also recommend getting there a few minutes early so you can ask questions and explain what you want.
