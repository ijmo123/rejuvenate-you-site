Get rid of unwanted and uncomfortable body hair with our full butt and butt strip waxing service!

Butt hair is one of the most ignored topics, but you can confess it can be a nuisance when it's there.

Butt waxing is a process that involves the removal of hair on the back cheeks, back slips, and around the butt crack. It also comprises the removal of hair on the front and the entire genitalia. Like other types of waxing, butt waxing lasts much longer than shaving, making the area much cleaner. The procedure takes very little time and has fewer chances of unsightly bumps.&nbsp;

Our range of butt waxing services includes:

The procedure consists of a few simple stages, such as applying heated wax to the skin in the region where the hair is to be removed and then pulling the hair out by the roots. For this procedure, other kinds of waxes may be used, but the wax that is used the most is called hard wax. This is because hard wax is better for the skin and makes the removal process less unpleasant.

The full butt waxing service is a hair removal method designed for those who desire to eliminate all hair from the entire backside, including the butt strip and cheek areas. Compared to the butt strip waxing, this service offers a more comprehensive and thorough hair removal experience.

This method is ideal if you desire a smooth and clean feeling, especially when wearing lingerie, swimsuits, and other types of clothing that expose the backside. The waxing techniques used during this service are gentle and effective, ensuring maximum comfort during the process.

The process of full butt waxing is similar to butt strip waxing, but it requires more care and precision due to the sensitivity of the area. The wax is applied evenly and smoothly to minimize discomfort. A trained professional will ensure that the wax is applied correctly to prevent any discomfort and ensure a smooth and clean result.

Butt waxing is less likely to cause bumps, rash, or irritation than shaving or using an epilator. Since waxing pulls out hair from the root, the hair that grows back is usually weaker, thinner, and softer. This means you will have less hair growing back when you get more waxing sessions.

If you are planning to schedule a full butt wax or butt strip wax appointment, there are a few things to keep in mind. If you are a first-time customer, we advise that you contact us for specific tips and recommendations to help prepare you for your appointment. We want to ensure your comfort and safety during the process and provide you with the best possible experience.
