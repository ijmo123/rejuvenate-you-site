The sort of thing I love is the science behind underarm hyperpigmentation and why it happens. Melanin, our skin's natural pigment, plays a significant role in this common condition.

Our skin produces more melanin as a protective response to irritation or damage. This reaction, known as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), causes dark underarms in most people. Each person's melanin production differs, which explains why some people develop darker underarms more easily than others.

Improper shaving or harsh waxing techniques leading to shaving irritation

Inadequate exfoliation leads to dead skin cell buildup

Tight-fitting clothes create friction

Antiperspirants or deodorants with alcohol or fragrances cause irritation
