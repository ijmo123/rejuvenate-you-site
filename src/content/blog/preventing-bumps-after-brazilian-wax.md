Exfoliating can be done physically and chemically. Both are critical to prevent and treat ingrown hairs. Physical exfoliating is when you take a abrasive washcloth, textured glove or exfoliating towel, chemical exfoliate is done with using products with ingredients, such as AHA’s and BHA’s&nbsp;

Using products with AHA or BHA can help keep the skin smooth and clear, reducing the likelihood of hairs becoming trapped and growing inward.

Experiencing bumps after a Brazilian wax can be a frustrating side effect, but understanding the common causes and knowing how to treat and prevent them can help you achieve the smooth, bump-free skin you desire. By choosing a reputable waxing service like Rejuvenate You and following proper pre- and post-waxing care, you can minimize the risk of bumps and enjoy longer-lasting results.

Bumps after waxing typically last a few days to a week, depending on the cause and how well they are treated. If bumps persist beyond a week, consider consulting a dermatologist.

While not common, some individuals may experience an allergic reaction to the wax or other products used during the waxing process. Symptoms include redness, itching, and bumps; if these occur, discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider.
