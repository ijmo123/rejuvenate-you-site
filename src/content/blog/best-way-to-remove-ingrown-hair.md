Ingrown hairs are more common than most people realize—and more frustrating. They happen when a hair curls back into the skin or gets trapped beneath the surface instead of growing outward. The result? Redness, bumps, tenderness, and sometimes even painful inflammation. Whether they appear on your legs, bikini line, face, or underarms, knowing the best way to remove ingrown hair can make a world of difference for both comfort and confidence.

Below, you’ll find five dermatologist-approved ingrown hair removal methods that help you treat the issue safely while preventing it from coming back.

Exfoliation is one of the simplest and most effective ways to reduce ingrown hairs. When dead skin builds up on the surface, it blocks the follicle — leaving the hair nowhere to go but sideways. Gentle exfoliation helps clear the path so the hair can push through naturally.

The key is gentleness. Over-exfoliating or using harsh scrubs can irritate the skin and worsen inflammation.

•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Underarms

•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Arms

•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Chest

Use exfoliants 2–3 times weekly for best results.

Warm compresses are ideal for painful or inflamed ingrown hairs. The heat softens both the skin and the hair, making it easier for the trapped strand to move toward the surface without forceful extraction.
