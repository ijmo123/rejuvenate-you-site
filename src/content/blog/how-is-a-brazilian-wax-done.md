## Full-Body Brazilian Wax

A **[full-body Brazilian wax](/brazilian-wax-scottsdale)** is a hair removal technique that removes all of the body hair from the bikini line and beyond. This type of waxing is often used to achieve a **completely smooth and hairless look**.

**Note:** Full-body Brazilian wax is **not recommended for those new to waxing**.

If your skin is sensitive to shaving and you're looking for an alternative hair removal option, a Brazilian wax is your best bet.

Brazilian waxing can be done on **both men and women**, although it's more common among women due to its ability to remove most or all of the hair in such an intimate area.

Although some people may feel uncomfortable when undergoing a Brazilian wax, it's typically **not an overly painful experience** as long as it's done by a qualified technician.

## How a Brazilian Wax Is Done: What To Expect

If you're considering getting a Brazilian wax but aren't sure what to expect, here's the complete process from start to finish:

### The Brazilian Wax Process

1. **Preparation**
   - Hair should be at least **1/4 inch long**
   - If hair is too short, wax won't grab and remove it effectively
   - Take a shower beforehand to clean the area and reduce infection risk

2. **Consultation**
   - Fill out a form upon arrival
   - Discuss any concerns with your esthetician
   - Your esthetician explains the procedure and answers questions

3. **Positioning**
   - Undress from the waist down
   - Lie down on the treatment table
   - May be given a towel or paper sheet for coverage

4. **Application of Wax**
   - Warm wax applied to pubic area using a wooden spatula
   - Applied in small, manageable sections

5. **Removal of Wax**
   - Once wax cools and hardens, quickly removed
   - Pulled in the **opposite direction of hair growth**
   - Removes hair from the root

6. **Repeat**
   - Process continues until all unwanted hair is removed

7. **Cleanup**
   - Remaining wax removed using special oil
   - Soothing cream or lotion applied to reduce redness

It's essential to choose an **experienced esthetician** and follow proper preparation and aftercare instructions to minimize discomfort and reduce the risk of infection. Despite the potential discomfort, many people find the **long-lasting results worth the effort**.
