Discover the differences between Brazilian and bikini waxing. We'll explain 
what they involve, the areas covered, and what to expect. Whether you're 
new to waxing or an expert, we've got you covered.


## What’s The Difference Between A Brazilian and A Bikini Wax?

## Types of intimate Waxes

Depending on the salon you go to, there can be different versions of a Bikini wax. Even calling the Brazilian by a different name such as “The Hollywood”.&nbsp; What differentiates them is how much hair you want to be removed and from where. Your waxer should be asking you questions along the way to make sure you're comfortable with what is being removed.&nbsp; Keep in mind, each salon may have other names for different types of Bikini wax services:

This version of the Brazilian wax also has the option of no hair left, removing all the hair on the top of the pubic area and between the butt.

Both hard wax and soft wax get the job done by removing the hair from the root allowing the skin to stay smooth longer than shaving. By pulling the hair from the root, it allows more time for the new hair to grow in soft.

Whether a Brazilian or bikini wax is better depends on what you require. How much your swimsuit reveals or just simply the desire to feel cleaner with having the hair removed from the inner butt cheeks. That's because the difference between a Brazilian and bikini wax is just the added butt strip.&nbsp;

So, for example, you can leave a triangle shape of hair on the pubic mon and wax rest, the labia all the way back including between the buttocks then a Brazilian wax is ideal for you.&nbsp;

Now, let's discuss the bikini wax. Below is a brief breakdown of what typically occurs during a bikini wax.

Your esthetician will ask you to lay on your back with your legs in the butterfly position, the area will be cleaned and a protective oil barrier applied. If using hard wax your esthetician will apply the wax using a clean wax spatula (stick) and dispose of it once done. Your esthetician will apply another strip of wax allowing time for the first strip to dry, and once ready, your esthetician will quickly remove the first strip, and continue the pattern by laying another one during drying time. This allows the service to be fast with little discomfort while removing the wax and the hair from the root.

To ensure the best experience possible, follow these instructions after your bikini wax. Avoid standing water, such as pools and lakes, wear loose clothing to avoid uncomfortable friction, and wait 24 hours before engaging in sexual activity.

In addition, avoid sweating in the pubic area, perfume, or highly fragranced products because this can irritate the skin. Instead, apply a non-fragranced serum or oil that your wax provider suggested to the area twice a day for a few days after the waxing.

Next, let's discuss the Brazilian wax procedure. This type of procedure involves more waxing and is very much similar to the bikini wax service it has the same position and pattern of laying the hard wax strips.&nbsp;
