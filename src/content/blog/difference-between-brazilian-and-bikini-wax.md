# What's the Difference Between Brazilian and Bikini Wax?

Discover the **differences between Brazilian and bikini waxing**. We'll explain what they involve, the areas covered, and what to expect. Whether you're new to waxing or an expert, we've got you covered.

## What's the Difference Between a Brazilian and a Bikini Wax?

The main **difference between a Brazilian and bikini wax** comes down to **how much hair is removed** and **from where**. While both services remove unwanted hair from the bikini area, they vary significantly in coverage, experience, and results.

## The Bikini Line

The **bikini line** refers to the area where pubic hair may be visible outside of underwear or swimwear. Both services address this area, but to different extents.

### Basic Bikini Wax Coverage

A standard **bikini wax** typically includes:

- Hair removal **outside the panty line**
- The **sides** of the pubic area
- **Top edge** of the bikini line (optional)
- **Does NOT** include labia or buttocks

**Best for:** Those wanting simple cleanup for swimwear season or regular maintenance.

## Types of Bikini Waxes

Depending on the salon you go to, there can be different versions of a **bikini wax**. Even calling the Brazilian by a different name such as **"The Hollywood"**. What differentiates them is **how much hair you want removed** and **from where**.

**Important:** Your waxer should be asking you questions along the way to make sure you're comfortable with what is being removed. Keep in mind, each salon may have other names for different types of bikini wax services.

### Extended Bikini Wax

- Goes **deeper inside** the panty line
- May include some hair from the **top**
- Still does not include **labia or buttocks**

### French Bikini Wax (Landing Strip)

- Removes hair from the **sides and labia**
- Leaves a **strip or triangle** of hair on top
- Does **not** include the buttocks

## The Brazilian Wax

A **Brazilian wax** is the most comprehensive option, removing **all or nearly all** pubic hair.

### Full Brazilian Coverage

- **All hair** on the pubic area (front)
- **All hair** on the labia
- **Between the buttocks** (the "butt strip")
- Can leave a **small strip or triangle** if desired (modified Brazilian)
- Or **completely bare** (full Brazilian/Hollywood)

This version of the Brazilian wax has the option of **no hair left**, removing all the hair on the top of the pubic area and between the butt.

### Key Differences Summary

| Feature | Bikini Wax | Brazilian Wax |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Coverage** | Panty line only | Complete front to back |
| **Duration** | 10-15 minutes | 20-40 minutes |
| **Price** | **$25-$45** | **$50-$100+** |
| **Discomfort** | Mild | More intense |
| **Results Last** | 2-3 weeks | 3-6 weeks |
| **Best For** | Basic maintenance | Complete smoothness |

## Types of Intimate Waxes

Whether a **Brazilian or bikini wax is better** depends on what you require. How much your swimsuit reveals or just simply the desire to feel cleaner with having the hair removed from the inner butt cheeks. 

**Key Point:** The difference between a Brazilian and bikini wax is often just the **added butt strip**.

**Examples of customization:**

- Leave a **triangle shape** of hair on the pubic mound and wax the rest
- Remove hair from the **labia all the way back** including between the buttocks
- Go **completely bare** or leave a **landing strip**

So, for example, if you want the labia waxed all the way back including between the buttocks, then a **Brazilian wax is ideal for you**.

## What to Expect: The Bikini Wax Procedure

Now, let's discuss the **bikini wax procedure**. Below is a brief breakdown of what typically occurs during a bikini wax.

### During Your Appointment

1. **Positioning:** Your esthetician will ask you to lay on your back with your legs in the **butterfly position**
2. **Cleansing:** The area will be cleaned and a **protective oil barrier** applied
3. **Wax Application:** If using hard wax, your esthetician will apply the wax using a **clean wax spatula (stick)** and dispose of it once done
4. **Technique:** Your esthetician will apply another strip of wax, allowing time for the first strip to dry
5. **Removal:** Once ready, your esthetician will quickly remove the first strip, and continue the pattern by laying another one during drying time

This allows the service to be **fast with little discomfort** while removing the wax and the hair from the root.

### Bikini Wax Aftercare

To ensure the best experience possible, follow these instructions after your bikini wax:

- **Avoid standing water** such as pools and lakes for **24-48 hours**
- **Wear loose clothing** to avoid uncomfortable friction
- Wait **24 hours** before engaging in sexual activity
- Avoid **sweating** in the pubic area
- Skip **perfume** or highly fragranced products because this can irritate the skin
- Apply a **non-fragranced serum or oil** that your wax provider suggested to the area **twice a day** for a few days after the waxing

## What to Expect: The Brazilian Wax Procedure

Next, let's discuss the **Brazilian wax procedure**. This type of procedure involves more waxing and is very much similar to the bikini wax service — it has the **same position and pattern** of laying the hard wax strips.

### Additional Elements

- **More comprehensive coverage** of the pubic area
- Includes the **labia** and **between the buttocks**
- May require **additional positioning** (on your side, holding legs)
- Takes **longer** than a basic bikini wax

Both **hard wax** and **soft wax** get the job done by removing the hair from the root, allowing the skin to stay smooth longer than shaving. By pulling the hair from the root, it allows more time for the new hair to grow in soft.

**Choose a Bikini Wax if you:**

- Want **minimal hair removal**
- Are **new to waxing**
- Have a **lower pain tolerance**

**Choose a Brazilian Wax if you:**

- Want **complete smoothness**
- Wear **thongs or high-cut styles**
- Want **longest-lasting results**
- Prefer **no maintenance** for 3-6 weeks
- Want to **reduce hair growth** over time

At **Rejuvenate You**, our skilled estheticians will guide you through the process, answer your questions, and ensure you're comfortable with your choice — whether that's a **bikini wax** or a **full Brazilian**.
