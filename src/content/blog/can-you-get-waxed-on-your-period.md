## Best Types of Wax for Menstrual Waxing

For waxing during your period, **hard wax** is the recommended option.

Hard wax is particularly beneficial during menstruation when skin may be more reactive.

## Tips for a Smooth Waxing Experience During Your Period

Follow these guidelines to ensure comfort and confidence:

### Before Your Appointment

- **Schedule wisely** — If possible, book for the least sensitive days of your period (typically the later days)
- **Freshen up** — Use the restroom and change your tampon or menstrual cup before your session
- **Pain management** — Take an over-the-counter pain reliever (ibuprofen or acetaminophen) about 30 minutes before
- **Cleanliness** — Most professional studios provide cleaning wipes and fresh tampons in their restrooms

### During Your Appointment

- **Wear a tampon** — Essential for hygiene and comfort during intimate waxing
- **Communicate** — Let your esthetician know you're on your period (they're professionals and it's completely normal)
- **Relax** — Tension can increase sensitivity, so practice deep breathing
- **Be prepared** — Bring an extra tampon to change into after your appointment

### After Your Wax

- **Wear comfortable clothing** — Loose clothing reduces irritation as your skin calms
