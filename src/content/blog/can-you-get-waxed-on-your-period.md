Yes, it is perfectly safe to get waxed during your period. However, there are a few factors you might want to consider before booking your appointment. Firstly, skin sensitivity tends to increase the few days before menstruation and sometimes till the first few days of your period due to hormonal changes. This can result in a more painful waxing experience than usual. Additionally, because your body is already going through a lot during this time, you might experience heightened discomfort.

For menstrual waxing, hard wax is the recommended option due to its several advantages, especially for sensitive skin that may be more delicate during your period. Hard wax uniquely adheres only to the hair, not the skin, which significantly reduces discomfort and the risk of irritation or redness. This feature is particularly beneficial during menstruation when the skin may be more sensitive. Additionally, hard wax is effective at removing shorter hairs, which means fewer applications and less chance of irritating the skin, making it an ideal choice for a comfortable waxing experience.

At Rejuvenate You, we use premium hard wax and employ skilled techniques to ensure that your waxing experience is as comfortable and efficient as possible, regardless of the timing of your menstrual cycle.

Many people experience increased skin sensitivity right before menstruation due to hormonal fluctuations but once it starts the sensitivity subsides. Taking a pain reliever prior to your appointment can help reduce discomfort.

No, waxing during your period does not affect the results of the wax. The hair removal will be just as effective, though you may experience slightly more redness or swelling due to increased sensitivity.

There's no need to reschedule unless you are particularly uncomfortable. Professional waxing studios are equipped to handle waxing during your period, and simple precautions like using a fresh tampon can help maintain hygiene and comfort.

Yes, it's quite common. Many clients continue with their regular waxing schedule during their period, and professional waxing&nbsp; studios are well-prepared to accommodate them with little to no discomfort.
