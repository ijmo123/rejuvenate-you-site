Understanding the causes of razor burn is essential for preventing it. Some common causes include using dull or dirty razors, applying too much pressure while shaving, shaving against the grain, lack of lubrication, and not properly preparing the skin before shaving. These factors can lead to irritation and inflammation, resulting in razor burn.

Keep the skin hydrated and moisturized before shaving.

Exfoliate the area to remove dead skin cells and help prevent ingrown hairs.

Use a sharp and clean razor specifically designed for sensitive areas.

Shave in the direction of hair growth to minimize irritation.

Apply a shaving cream or gel to provide lubrication and protect the skin.

Avoid shaving the same area repeatedly to prevent irritation.

Rinse the razor frequently while shaving to remove hair and debris.

Use gentle and light strokes while shaving to avoid applying excessive pressure.

After shaving, rinse the area with cold water to soothe the skin and close the pores.
