A lymphatic drainage facial is a specialized skincare treatment designed to stimulate the lymphatic system, a crucial component of our body's natural detoxification process. This therapeutic technique involves gentle, rhythmic massage movements that aim to promote the drainage of excess fluid, toxins, and waste products from the tissues.&nbsp;
