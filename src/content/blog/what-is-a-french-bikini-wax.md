What is a **French bikini wax**? Discover the nuances of this popular waxing style, detailing what sets it apart from traditional bikini waxes.

## Understanding the Basics of Bikini Waxes

Before diving into the specifics of a French bikini wax, it's important to understand the general concept of bikini waxing:

- **Bikini line wax** — Removes hair visible around bikini bottom edges
- **French bikini wax** — Removes more hair while leaving a strip or triangle
- **Brazilian wax** — Removes all or most pubic hair

This practice allows for a neat, clean appearance when wearing swimwear or lingerie.

## What Is a French Bikini Wax?

A **French bikini wax** (also known as a "landing strip") removes hair from:

- The sides (bikini line)
- The top area
- Most of the intimate area

**Leaves behind:** A vertical strip or small triangle of hair on the pubic bone.

This style offers a **middle ground** between a standard bikini wax and a full Brazilian.

|---------|---------------|---------------|

| Look | Natural but tidy | Clean with intentional design |
