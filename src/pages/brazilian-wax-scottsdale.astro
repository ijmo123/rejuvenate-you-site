    question: "How painful is a Brazilian wax?",
    answer: "Everyone has a different pain threshold, but our esthetician can reduce pain and discomfort by getting wax to the right temperature. It should be hot enough to melt not warm enough to hurt your skin. The experienced esthetician will have mind-body techniques such as breathing suggestions and other ways to calm the pain receptors."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between Brazilian and Bikini wax?",
    answer: "When you select the Brazilian wax method, you can tell your esthetician whether you want full coverage or want some hair to remain. For example, some women keep a small triangle, a small strip, or a square shape. A bikini wax only removes hair that would be visible around the bikini line."
  },
  {
    question: "How should I prepare for my Brazilian wax?",
    answer: "Take a warm shower before your Brazilian wax session. It will help to open up the pores and make it easier for the wax to adhere to the hair. Exfoliate the area before Brazilian waxing. Don't use any creams or lotions before Brazilian waxing. Trim any pubic hairs before coming in for your session. Make sure you have at least ¼ inch of growth."

      Opting for our full Brazilian wax service in Scottsdale offers many advantages. Consider the negative aspects of shaving. When you shave, the hair can grow thicker, itchier, and coarser. The shaving process doesn't provide a long-term solution either.

      You can also choose to use a bikini full wax. The bikini full waxing procedure removes the hair from around the mons pubis area. The mons pubis area covers the lower abdomen and extends to the labia. The process does not include the rear area.
