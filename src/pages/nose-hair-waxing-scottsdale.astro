  {
    question: "Does nose hair waxing hurt?",
    answer: "Nose hair waxing is quick and the discomfort is brief. Most clients find it much more tolerable than they expected, and the results last much longer than trimming. The sensation is similar to a quick pinch that lasts only a second."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it safe to wax nose hair?",
    answer: "Yes, when done professionally. We only wax the visible hairs at the entrance of the nostrils. We never wax deep inside the nose, which protects the cilia (tiny hairs) that help filter dust and particles from the air you breathe."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does nose hair waxing last?",
    answer: "Nose hair waxing typically lasts 3-4 weeks, much longer than daily trimming. You'll enjoy clean nostrils without the daily maintenance or worrying about visible nose hair."
  },
  {
    question: "Why shouldn't I just trim my nose hair?",
    answer: "Trimming only cuts the hair at the surface, leaving sharp ends that can feel prickly and still be visible. Waxing removes the hair from the root, giving you completely smooth nostrils with no stubble for weeks. Plus, daily trimming is time-consuming and easy to forget."
  },
  {
    question: "Can women get nose hair waxing too?",
    answer: "Absolutely! While often associated with men's grooming, many women choose nose hair waxing to remove any visible nose hair for a cleaner, more polished appearance. It's a quick and effective solution for anyone concerned about nose hair."

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" style="color: #7B2D8E;">The Process</h2>

<div class="bg-purple-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
  <p class="mb-4">Our nose hair waxing procedure is quick, safe, and effective. Here's what you can expect during your appointment:</p>
  
  <ol class="space-y-4">
    <li class="flex items-start">
      <span class="font-bold mr-3 text-purple-700">1.</span>
      <div>
        <strong>Consultation & Prep</strong> — We discuss any concerns and cleanse the area around the nostrils to ensure optimal wax adherence.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="flex items-start">
      <span class="font-bold mr-3 text-purple-700">2.</span>
      <div>
        <strong>Safe Application</strong> — A small amount of warm, high-quality hard wax is carefully applied to the visible hairs at the nostril entrance using a specialized applicator designed for this sensitive area.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="flex items-start">
      <span class="font-bold mr-3 text-purple-700">3.</span>
      <div>
        <strong>Quick Removal</strong> — Once the wax has set, it's removed in one swift motion, taking the unwanted hairs with it. The discomfort is brief and most clients find it very manageable.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="flex items-start">
      <span class="font-bold mr-3 text-purple-700">4.</span>
      <div>
        <strong>Soothing Finish</strong> — A calming, antiseptic product is applied to minimize any redness and soothe the area. You'll be ready to go about your day immediately!
      </div>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" style="color: #7B2D8E;">Safety First</h2>

<div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
  <p class="mb-4">
    <strong>Important Safety Information:</strong> We only remove visible hairs at the entrance of the nostrils. We <em>never</em> wax deep inside the nose. This is crucial because the cilia (tiny hairs deeper in the nasal passages) serve an important function — they help filter dust, pollen, and other particles from the air you breathe.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Our trained estheticians at Rejuvenate You Scottsdale use professional techniques and high-quality hard wax specifically designed for sensitive areas. Your safety and comfort are our top priorities.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have any respiratory conditions or concerns about nose hair waxing, please consult with us before your appointment.
