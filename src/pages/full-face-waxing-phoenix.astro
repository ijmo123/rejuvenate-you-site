    question: "What is full face waxing?",
    answer: "Full face waxing is a process that consists of removing unwanted hair from your cheeks, lip, sideburns, eyebrows, chin, forehead, and nose. Unlike bleaching or shaving, the entire hair follicle gets removed during a waxing treatment. This complete removal is why waxing is the best way to remove unwanted facial hair. There is also little to no downtime after waxing."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does full face waxing take?",
    answer: "Full face waxing typically takes 20-30 minutes depending on the amount of hair and areas being treated."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I get my face waxed?",
    answer: "Most clients schedule face waxing every 3-4 weeks. Facial hair tends to grow faster than body hair, so more frequent maintenance may be needed. However, with regular waxing, hair grows back finer and slower over time."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get my face waxed if I'm using retinol or acne medication?",
    answer: "If you are on medications containing high-strength topical Vitamin A or high-strength acne medications, like Accutane, avoid getting a facial wax. Wait until you are off these medications for at least six months before scheduling a waxing appointment. Avoid chemical peels, microdermabrasion treatments, laser treatments, fillers, anti-wrinkle injectables, or topical skin care products containing Retinol, Retin-A, Steroids, or Hydroquinone for at least two weeks before your wax."

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" style="color: #7B2D8E;">What is Full Face Waxing?</h2>

<div class="bg-purple-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
  <p class="mb-4">
    Full face waxing is a process that consists of removing unwanted hair from your cheeks, <a href="/upper-lip-wax-phoenix" class="text-purple-700 hover:underline">lip</a>, sideburns, <a href="/eyebrow-waxing-phoenix" class="text-purple-700 hover:underline">eyebrows</a>, chin, forehead, and nose.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Unlike bleaching or shaving, the entire hair follicle gets removed during a waxing treatment. This complete removal is why waxing is the best way to remove unwanted facial hair. There is also little to no downtime after waxing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many types of wax can get used to perform this treatment. Usually, waxing specialists use hard wax because it makes the removal less painful and is generally safer for the skin. However, soft wax or other wax types might be used by certain studios and technicians.
  </p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" style="color: #7B2D8E;">The Purpose of Full Face Waxing</h2>

<div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
  <div class="flex flex-col justify-center">
    <p class="mb-4">
      The main purpose of full face waxing is to remove unwanted facial hair. A secondary purpose is to help exfoliate the skin and unclog hair follicles. Dead skin cells are removed with the hair simultaneously during a waxing session, so this secondary purpose is a bonus!
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Removing excess facial hair, especially darker hair, and removing the dirt and grime within the pores create a brighter complexion. The brightening can often make the skin look younger and healthier.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use serums and other skincare items, waxing will help these serums penetrate your skin more effectively. Without the extra barrier of facial hair and daily debris on your skin, the serum can get to work!

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" style="color: #7B2D8E;">The Benefits of Full Face Waxing</h2>

<div class="bg-purple-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
  <p class="mb-4">
    As mentioned, the benefits of full face waxing are numerous! Not only will your skin be free of unwanted hair, but it will also be brighter, more healthy looking, and might even look younger after waxing!
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    If you have waxed part of your face before, you likely know the incredible feeling of smoother skin post-wax. You likely know how your makeup applies easier without those small pesky hairs getting in the way. You also probably like the way your skin glows without the extra hair.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Why not remove unwanted hair on the entire face to complete the look?
  </p>
  <p>
    Another benefit of full face waxing is that your hair will grow back finer after waxing. Finer hair allows for a less painful wax the second time around and slower hair growth.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" style="color: #7B2D8E;">What To Expect</h2>

<p class="mb-6">
  There are a few things to be aware of when you go into your full face wax appointment. If you have never received a facial wax before, call the studio for their specific tips and recommendations on jumping into full facial waxing.
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4" style="color: #7B2D8E;">Before Your Appointment</h3>

<div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
  <p class="mb-4">
    If you are on medications containing high-strength topical Vitamin A or high-strength acne medications, like Accutane, avoid getting a facial wax. Wait until you are off these medications for at least six months before scheduling a waxing appointment.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Avoid chemical peels, microdermabrasion treatments, laser treatments, fillers, anti-wrinkle injectables, or topical skin care products containing Retinol, Retin-A, Steroids, or Hydroquinone for at least two weeks before your wax. Avoiding these products sets your skin up to handle the waxing session perfectly.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Do not use skin products containing AHA or BHA for at least one week before the full face wax. Avoid granular scrubs and harsh facial scrubbing as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you arrive at the studio on the day of your wax appointment, arrive barefaced without any makeup on. The studio will likely cleanse the face of any unwanted oils, sunscreens, or moisturizers before the wax, but arriving barefaced helps speed up the process.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4" style="color: #7B2D8E;">During Your Appointment</h3>

<div class="bg-purple-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
  <p class="mb-4">
    Once you are cleansed and prepped, the waxing specialist will ask you to lie down, so they can look at your face and properly assess what areas should be waxed. This step is most crucial for the eyebrows! They will ask a few questions about your preferences, skin concerns, and waxing experience to be sure you are on the same page about your treatment plan and what to expect.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can expect certain areas, like the lip and the eyebrow, to be more painful than areas with thicker skin, like the forehead or chin. The skin is more delicate, and the hair is usually more coarse in those spots, causing more discomfort.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4" style="color: #7B2D8E;">After Your Appointment</h3>

<div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
  <p class="mb-4">
    After waxing, follow any instructions your specialist gives you. It is a good idea to avoid wearing makeup, touching your face, or putting other products on for the first 12-24 hours after a facial. Waxing opens your pores. Dirt, debris, and bacteria are more likely to invade your pores in this first-day window.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Your skin will likely be a little pink immediately following the session, but this is normal and is likely due to hair removal. Contact the studio or your dermatologist if you experience irritation or abnormal redness after your wax.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your wax should last anywhere from 2-4 weeks.
  </p>
</div>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" style="color: #7B2D8E;">Aftercare Instructions</h2>

<div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
  <div class="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-3 text-green-700">✓ Do's</h3>
    <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700 text-sm">
      <li>• <strong>Chill out:</strong> Give your skin some time to recover from the waxing process. Avoid strenuous physical activity or sun exposure for at least 24 hours.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Exfoliate with care:</strong> Gently exfoliate the waxed area 2-3 times a week to keep those pesky ingrown hairs at bay.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate:</strong> Moisturize the area daily to keep your skin looking and feeling its best.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Cool it down:</strong> If redness or irritation occurs, a cool compress or aloe vera gel will be your skin's best friend.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-3 text-red-700">✗ Don'ts</h3>
    <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700 text-sm">
      <li>• <strong>Stay away from heat:</strong> Hot showers, hot tubs, saunas, and swimming are a no-go for at least 24 hours after waxing.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Nix the nasties:</strong> Avoid any products that contain alcohol, fragrances, or dyes on the treated area.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Cover up:</strong> Avoid tight clothing and direct sun exposure for at least 24 hours to prevent any irritation.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Resist the urge to pick:</strong> Don't pick or scratch the treated area, as this can lead to infection and scarring.</li>
    </ul>
