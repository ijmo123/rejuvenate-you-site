## About Me

While not at work you’ll find me looking for adventures and opportunities to make every experience a learning experience for my two kiddo’s, I feel like parenting is just like life coaching. My husband has been the best partner while raising our two kids, a preteen and teenager. I love hiking, dancing and lifting heavy things for fun! I find myself always in gratitude when I hike during sunrise and sunset so I try to go a few times a week.
