# Microneedling Scottsdale

Minimize unsightly blemishes by stimulating your skin's natural collagen production with our microneedling treatments.

## What is Microneedling?

Microneedling is a minimally invasive treatment that uses fine needles to create micro-injuries in the skin. This triggers your body's natural healing response, stimulating collagen and elastin production.

- Reduces pore size
- Stimulates natural collagen production
- Little to no downtime
