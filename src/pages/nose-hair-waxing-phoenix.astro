  <p class="mb-4">
    <strong>Important:</strong> We only remove visible hairs at the entrance of the nostrils. We never wax deep inside the nose. This protects the cilia (tiny hairs) that help filter dust and particles from the air you breathe.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our trained estheticians use professional techniques and high-quality wax specifically designed for sensitive areas.

<p class="text-lg mb-6">
  Nose hair waxing is the perfect add-on to any other service. Many clients combine it with ear hair waxing, eyebrow waxing, or their regular haircut appointments for complete grooming.
