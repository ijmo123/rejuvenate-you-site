## 7 Tips to Help Prevent Ingrown Hairs After Waxing

## Tip #1. Exfoliate Regularly

Ingrown hairs occur when hair regrows and bends back into the skin, causing inflammation and sometimes infection. They can appear as small bumps on the skin, often accompanied by redness, itching, and pain.&nbsp;

Understanding the causes of ingrown hairs can help guide the prevention and treatment strategies recommended, ensuring smoother and healthier skin post-hair removal.

Regular exfoliation is key in preventing ingrown hairs. By removing dead skin cells, oils, and dirt from the surface of your skin, you clear the path for hair to grow outward. Aim to exfoliate 2-3 times a week with a gentle scrub or use chemical exfoliants like AHAs or BHAs for more sensitive areas. Be careful not to over-exfoliate, as this can lead to irritation and worsen the problem.

Hydrated skin is more pliable, making it easier for hairs to break through the surface. Use a fragrance-free, non-comedogenic moisturizer to keep your skin soft and supple. Apply moisturizer daily, focusing on areas prone to waxing and ingrown hairs.

The technique and quality of waxing play a significant role in preventing ingrown hairs. Hard wax, for example, is often better for sensitive areas as it adheres to the hair rather than the skin, reducing irritation. Ensure that the waxing is done in the direction of hair growth and removed in the opposite direction in a swift, clean motion to minimize hair breakage.

After waxing, avoid tight clothing that can irritate the skin and trap hairs beneath the surface. Loose, breathable fabrics will reduce friction and allow the skin to heal and hairs to grow properly.

There are various products designed to prevent and treat ingrown hairs. These often contain exfoliating acids like glycolic acid, salicylic acid, or retinoids that help keep the skin clear. Serums and creams formulated for post-wax care can significantly reduce the occurrence of ingrown hairs. Apply according to product instructions for best results.

Shaving between waxing sessions can disrupt the hair growth cycle, increasing the likelihood of ingrown hairs. If you must remove hair between waxes, consider other methods that maintain the hair direction and length, such as trimming.

While home waxing kits are available, professional waxing services offer the advantage of expert techniques, high-quality products, and advice tailored to your skin and hair type. Professionals can also recommend post-wax care products and routines specific to your needs.

Waxing can both help and hinder in the fight against ingrown hairs. On the one hand, waxing removes hair from the root, which can reduce the likelihood of hair growing back into the skin compared to shaving. On the other hand, waxing can sometimes cause hair to break at the surface instead of being pulled from the root, which can increase the risk of ingrown hairs. Therefore, the key to preventing ingrown hairs after waxing lies in the technique used and the post-waxing care.
