    question: "How often should I get my eyebrows waxed?",
    answer: "Most people get their eyebrows waxed every 4-6 weeks, depending on their hair growth. However, if your eyebrows grow nicely and without any stray hairs, you can push this time frame to between 6-8 weeks. In between sessions, we don't recommend tweezing stray hairs. When tweezing between waxing, it will prevent the hair from growing in on the same cycle. The hair follicle has four different stages. In fact, the more you wax on a 4-week schedule the longer you will go with clean stray-free brows because the hair growth starts at the same time."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does eyebrow waxing take?",
    answer: "The average eyebrow waxing session is around 20 minutes, so it is a beauty procedure you can do during your lunch break or after work. It's quick, easy, and virtually painless."
  },
  {
    question: "How long will my skin be red after eyebrow waxing?",
    answer: "Your skin will probably be tender and red for 1-2 hours after the eyebrow waxing session. This is completely normal and should subside quickly."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get my eyebrows waxed if I'm using retinol?",
    answer: "We recommend stopping retinol products at least 5-7 days before your waxing appointment to avoid skin irritation or sensitivity."
  }

      src="/images/6358773dfa2fa42351f2e029_4422e106-38a8-4f25-b173-d2eff3a671ce_eyebrow-shape-outline.webp"

    <p class="mb-4">
      Why should you get eyebrow waxing instead of other techniques, like plucking, threading, and DIY kits? Getting your eyebrows waxed at a professional salon is the most accurate and precise removal method.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      If you choose threading, this method can't get the hairs buried underneath the skin, meaning you will have to thread your eyebrows more often.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      For those who want to try plucking, this method is time-consuming and often more painful. You can't see both brows at the same time like a professional can. This leads to thinner brows and an uneven shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, <a href="/dermaplaning-phoenix" class="text-purple-700 hover:underline">waxing</a> helps remove the "fuzz" you will find around the stray hairs, leading to a defined and contour brow shape.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" style="color: #7B2D8E;">The Process</h2>

<div class="mb-8">
  <img 
    src="/images/6358773dfa2fa42351f2e029_886dc122-ff4a-498f-b95b-3e99986eb926_sleek-eyebrow-shape.webp"

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4" style="color: #7B2D8E;">Before Your Appointment</h3>

<div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
  <p class="mb-4">
    Before you book an appointment, it is helpful to know what you can expect, the details of the procedure, and how to best prepare for your appointment. Eyebrow waxing involves looking at your eyebrows together as a team and mapping them out together.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use a thin layer of warm/hot wax on the hairs on the eyebrow that you want to get rid of. These could be hairs underneath the brow line, stray hairs on the outside, and hairs in the middle combining the two eyebrows. For the first few times, eyebrow waxing can be uncomfortable and slightly painful. However, the itching and burning feeling only lasts a few seconds.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4" style="color: #7B2D8E;">During Your Appointment</h3>

<div class="bg-purple-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
  <p class="mb-4">
    The process of getting your eyebrows waxed is quick, easy, and virtually painless. The average eyebrow waxing session is around 20 minutes, so it is a beauty procedure you can do during your lunch break or after work.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    The professional will escort you to the treatment bed and speak with you about the type of eyebrows you would like to have. They will ask you about the following:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4">
    <li>Previous eyebrow waxing sessions</li>
    <li>Desired shape</li>
    <li>Allergies</li>
    <li>Other important information</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-4">
    The stylist will then analyze your brow bone and your cheekbones to see the best shape for your eyebrows. Creating a soft arch helps add more definition if you have a round face. If you have a narrow and angular face, a straighter brow typically adds more contour.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Once you and your stylist have agreed on the type of brow and the shape, your stylist will clean the area. They will use a mild and odor-free cleanser to remove any makeup, bacteria, or dirt. Cleaning the area helps avoid any infection and acne that can arise from the warm wax.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Then, your stylist will trim the hair if need be. If clients would like a feathered brow or have longer eyebrow hairs, trimming can help tame the eyebrow shape before using the wax.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Next, the wax is warmed as the stylist applies a hydrating and moisturizing oil to the waxing location beneath, above, and between the brows. The stylist will apply the wax in the desired area to create a brow shape. The last step is grabbing ahold of the wax, and pulling it away firmly to remove the hairs.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4" style="color: #7B2D8E;">After Your Appointment</h3>

<div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
  <p class="mb-4">
    If your eyebrows are sore after the wax, or your skin is still red a few hours or days after the waxing, look into an aftercare process to help soothe your sensitive skin.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    If you still have wax residue on your skin after the process, use a fragrance-free cleansing agent to remove the wax. This process will help you avoid any allergic reactions and gently clean the surrounding areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, protecting the skin is the first tool in helping with the aftercare of a waxing session. We recommend using our serum which will help keep your skin hydrated and protect it against any damage.
  </p>
</div>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" style="color: #7B2D8E;">Aftercare Instructions</h2>

<div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
  <div class="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-3 text-green-700">✓ Do's</h3>
    <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700 text-sm">
      <li>• <strong>Chill out:</strong> Give your skin some time to recover from the waxing process. Avoid strenuous physical activity or sun exposure for at least 24 hours.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Exfoliate with care:</strong> Gently exfoliate the waxed area 2-3 times a week to keep those pesky ingrown hairs at bay.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate:</strong> Moisturize the area daily to keep your skin looking and feeling its best.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Cool it down:</strong> If redness or irritation occurs, a cool compress or aloe vera gel will be your skin's best friend.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-3 text-red-700">✗ Don'ts</h3>
    <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700 text-sm">
      <li>• <strong>Stay away from heat:</strong> Hot showers, hot tubs, saunas, and swimming are a no-go for at least 24 hours after waxing.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Nix the nasties:</strong> Avoid any products that contain alcohol, fragrances, or dyes on the treated area.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Cover up:</strong> Avoid tight clothing and direct sun exposure for at least 24 hours to prevent any irritation.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Resist the urge to pick:</strong> Don't pick or scratch the treated area, as this can lead to infection and scarring.</li>
    </ul>
