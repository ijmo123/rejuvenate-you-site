<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" style="color: #53009D;">What is Ear Hair Waxing?</h2>

<div class="bg-purple-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
  <p class="mb-4">
    Ear hair waxing is a specialized grooming technique designed to remove excess or unwanted hair from the ear area. We use a gentle yet highly effective approach to ensure a smooth and hair-free result.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our process begins with the application of warm, hypoallergenic wax to the external surface of the ear. This wax adheres to the hair, providing a firm grip. Once set, the wax is swiftly and comfortably removed, leaving you with smooth, hair-free ears.

      <li>• <strong>Exfoliate with care:</strong> Gently exfoliate the waxed area 2-3 times a week to keep those pesky ingrown hairs at bay.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate:</strong> Moisturize the area daily to keep your skin looking and feeling its best.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Cool it down:</strong> If redness or irritation occurs, a cool compress or aloe vera gel will be your skin's best friend.</li>

      <li>• <strong>Stay away from heat:</strong> Hot showers, hot tubs, saunas, and swimming are a no-go for at least 24 hours after waxing.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Nix the nasties:</strong> Avoid any products that contain alcohol, fragrances, or dyes on the treated area.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Cover up:</strong> Avoid tight clothing and direct sun exposure for at least 24 hours to prevent any irritation.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Resist the urge to pick:</strong> Don't pick or scratch the treated area, as this can lead to infection and scarring.</li>
