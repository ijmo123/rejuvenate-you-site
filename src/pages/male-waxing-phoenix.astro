    question: "How long does a men's waxing session take?",
    answer: "The duration varies depending on the area. Generally, sessions take 15-20 minutes for smaller areas like brows, 30-45 minutes for Brazilian, and about an hour for full-body waxing."
  },
  {
    question: "Is men's waxing painful?",
    answer: "Waxing may cause some discomfort, especially during the first session. However, our skilled estheticians use techniques like guided breathing to minimize pain. Regular waxing tends to be less painful as hair becomes finer over time."
  },
  {
    question: "How long should my hair be for waxing?",
    answer: "For best results, hair should be about 1/4 inch long, which is roughly the length of a grain of rice. Avoid trimming the hair too short before your appointment."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should men get waxed?",
    answer: "Most clients find that every 4-6 weeks is ideal for maintaining smooth skin. Your esthetician can provide personalized recommendations based on your hair growth."
