    question: "How long does a men's waxing session take?",
    answer: "The duration of a waxing session can vary depending on the area being waxed and individual factors. Generally, sessions can take anywhere from 15 minutes for smaller areas (e.g., brows) to about an hour or more for full-body waxing."
  },
  {
    question: "Is men's waxing painful?",
    answer: "Waxing may cause some discomfort, especially during the first session. However, our skilled estheticians use techniques to minimize pain. Regular waxing also tends to be less painful as hair becomes finer over time."
  },
  {
    question: "How long should my hair be for waxing?",
    answer: "For best results, hair should be about 1/4 inch long, which is roughly the length of a grain of rice. Avoid trimming the hair too short before your appointment."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should men get waxed?",
    answer: "The frequency of waxing sessions varies from person to person, but most clients find that every 4-6 weeks is ideal for maintaining smooth skin. Your esthetician can provide personalized recommendations."

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" style="color: #53009D;">What To Expect From Your Male Waxing Session</h2>

<p class="mb-6">The following are a few things to expect when you go for your wax appointment. If this is your first time receiving a wax, we recommend that you ask as many questions so that you know what to expect.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4" style="color: #53009D;">Preparation</h3>

<div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
  <p class="text-gray-700">
    Preparing for your waxing appointment is easy. Ensure your skin is clean and free of lotions or oils, and let your hair grow to the recommended length. Avoiding caffeine before your appointment can help reduce sensitivity. If you have any allergies or skin sensitivities, please let us know in advance.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4" style="color: #53009D;">The Experience</h3>

<div class="bg-purple-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
  <p class="text-gray-700">
    Our skilled esthetician (Danielle Morales) will make you feel comfortable throughout the entire process. We use high-quality wax and gentle techniques to minimize discomfort. You'll be amazed at how efficient and quick our services are.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4" style="color: #53009D;">Recovery</h3>

<div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
  <p class="text-gray-700">
    Following your waxing, you may experience mild redness or sensitivity, but this will subside within a few hours. Avoid sun exposure and hot baths immediately after your appointment, and be sure to moisturize to maintain smooth skin. To maintain your smooth, irritation-free skin, follow the post-waxing care tips outlined below.
  </p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" style="color: #53009D;">Aftercare Instructions</h2>

<div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8">
  <div class="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-3 text-green-700">✓ Do's</h3>
    <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700 text-sm">
      <li>• <strong>Chill out:</strong> Give your skin some time to recover from the waxing process. Avoid strenuous physical activity or sun exposure for at least 24 hours.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Exfoliate with care:</strong> Gently exfoliate the waxed area 2-3 times a week to keep those pesky ingrown hairs at bay.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate:</strong> Moisturize the area daily to keep your skin looking and feeling its best.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Cool it down:</strong> If redness or irritation occurs, a cool compress or aloe vera gel will be your skin's best friend.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-3 text-red-700">✗ Don'ts</h3>
    <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700 text-sm">
      <li>• <strong>Stay away from heat:</strong> Hot showers, hot tubs, saunas, and swimming are a no-go for at least 24 hours after waxing.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Nix the nasties:</strong> Avoid any products that contain alcohol, fragrances, or dyes on the treated area.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Cover up:</strong> Avoid tight clothing and direct sun exposure for at least 24 hours to prevent any irritation.</li>
      <li>• <strong>Resist the urge to pick:</strong> Don't pick or scratch the treated area, as this can lead to infection and scarring.</li>
    </ul>
