    question: "How much pain should I expect from a bikini wax?",
    answer: "Everyone has a different pain threshold, but our esthetician can reduce pain and discomfort by getting wax to the right temperature. The experienced esthetician will have mind-body techniques such as breathing suggestions and other ways to calm the pain receptors."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between a bikini and Brazilian wax?",
    answer: "A bikini wax removes hair that would be visible around the bikini line. A Brazilian wax removes all or most hair from the front, back, and everything in between. With a Brazilian, you can choose to leave a small strip, triangle, or go completely bare."
  },
  {
    question: "How should I prepare for my bikini wax?",
    answer: "Make sure you have at least ¼ inch of hair growth so that the wax can properly capture the hair. You can prep your skin with a warm bath or a gentle exfoliating product the night before your appointment."

    With shaving, you're cutting the hair above the root. The same hair will grow back and often develop a thick and stubbly feel as it does so. This process can be very uncomfortable, and results typically don't last more than a week.

      Everyone has a different pain threshold, but our esthetician can reduce pain and discomfort by getting wax to the right temperature. It should be hot enough to melt not warm enough to hurt your skin. The experienced esthetician will have mind-body techniques such as breathing suggestions and other ways to calm the pain receptors.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      There is also an expert gesture to tear off the wax in a swift motion. If done quickly and effectively, this part of the process causes brief and minimal pain.

      Don't hesitate to voice your concerns regarding pain and discomfort. Our esthetician will answer all your questions and make sure you have the most comfortable experience.
